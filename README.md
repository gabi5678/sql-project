I developed a bookstore management platform, covering aspects such as customers, suppliers, stocks, products and orders. I used the LDD and LMD commands to configure the processes as close as possible to the real needs of the business. I also performed data manipulation operations, including identifying the customers with the most orders, evaluating the suppliers with the highest product contributions, and analyzing the most requested or least requested products, and others.
